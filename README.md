# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I completed the **Sandwich Club** app, which shows 
a list of sandwiches and on clicking one of them, a new activity is 
opened with details about the selected sandwich. This project is 
part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What Have I Learned?
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
